This project contains a VNet with 2 subnets with NSGs attached. 2 virtual machines in those subnets with nginx installed and a custom Default.html webpage hosted on each one. An Azure Load Balancer with the VMs in the backend pool, a health probe, and load balancer rule. 

This was practice using modules.
